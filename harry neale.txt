Hired by the Vancouver Canucks prior to 1978, Neale coached the Canucks for almost four seasons. Late in the 1981â€“82 season, Neale was involved in an altercation with fans during a game in Quebec City against the Nordiques and was suspended for ten games. Assistant coach Roger Neilson was promoted interim coach during the suspension. When the Canucks lost only once in ten games, Neilson was given the job full-time as the team advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. At season's end, Neale was promoted to general manager (an arrangement made prior to the suspension).
