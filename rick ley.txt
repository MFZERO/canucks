Ley began his coaching career in International Hockey League, where he coached the Muskegon Lumberjacks to four first-place finishes and one championship during his tenure between 1984 and 1988. He was then hired by former Leafs defence partner Pat Quinn to coach the Vancouver Canucks IHL affiliate in Milwaukee.

After one season there, Ley was the coach of the Hartford Whalers for 2 seasons from 1989 to 1991, leading them to consecutive 4th place finishes and first round playoff defeats at the hands of their New England rival the Boston Bruins in both seasons.

Ley then rejoined the Canucks. After serving as an assistant coach under Quinn for three seasons from 1991–92 to 1993–94, Ley became the 12th head coach in Vancouver Canucks' history on August 10, 1994. In 121 regular season games as head coach, the Canucks posted a record of 47–48–26. He also served the Canucks in a professional scouting capacity in 1996–97 and 1997–98.
