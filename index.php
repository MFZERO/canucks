					<h2 class="prime">History of the Vancouver Canucks</h2>
			<p class="history"><strong>Vancouver became home to a professional ice hockey team for the first time in 1911</strong> when Patrick brothers Frank and Lester established the <strong>Vancouver Millionaires</strong>, one of three teams in the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association. To accommodate the Millionaires, the Patrick brothers directed the building of the Denman Arena, which was known at the time as the world's largest artificial ice rink (it burned down in 1936). <strong>The Millionaires played for the Stanley Cup five times, winning over the Ottawa Senators in 1915 on home ice</strong>. It marked the <strong>first</strong> time the Stanley Cup was won to a west coast team in the trophy's history.
				After the Millionaires <strong>disbanded following the 1925â€“26 season</strong>, Vancouver was home to only minor league teams for many years. Most notably, the present-day Canucks' minor league predecessor (also known as the Vancouver Canucks), played from 1945 to 1970 in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and Western Hockey League.</p>
